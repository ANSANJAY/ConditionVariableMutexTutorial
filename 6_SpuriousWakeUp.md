## Overview 🌐
This document provides insights into the concept of **Spurious Wakeups**, especially in the context of multithreading and thread synchronization. 

---

## What are Spurious Wakeups? ❓
- Spurious wakeups occur when a promise or expectation is broken or unfulfilled.
- There is no API or system call to prevent them. 
- It's the developer's responsibility to handle these in multithreaded applications.

---

## Real-world Examples 🌍
- **Example 1**: Going to a friend's house for a party only to find that the friend has left town.
- **Example 2**: Expecting sweets to be available after taking a bath, only to find the box empty.

In both examples, your expectations were shattered, akin to a spurious wakeup in computing.

---

## Relation with Multithreading 💻
- In a multithreading environment, a thread could resume its operation based on a condition that is no longer valid.
- This condition was initially the reason the thread was blocked.
- Resuming operation when the condition is unmet leads to a spurious wakeup for the thread.

---

## Preventing Spurious Wakeups 🛡️
- Programmers need to explicitly check conditions upon wake-up and decide on the subsequent course of action.

## Interview Questions ❓ with Answers ✅

### 1. What are spurious wakeups and how are they relevant in multithreading? 🤔
**Answer**: Spurious wakeups occur when a thread resumes its operation based on an unmet condition. They are relevant in multithreading because they can cause unexpected behavior and lead to bugs if not handled correctly.

### 2. Is there any system call or API that can prevent spurious wakeups? 🤔
**Answer**: No, there is no system call or API that can prevent spurious wakeups. It is the responsibility of the developer to manage these in their code.

### 3. Can you provide an example of a spurious wakeup in a real-world scenario? 🤔
**Answer**: A real-world example could be going to a friend's house for a party only to find out the friend has unexpectedly left town. Your expectation was that the friend would be there, similar to a thread expecting a condition to be met.

### 4. How can a developer prevent spurious wakeups in a multithreaded application? 🤔
**Answer**: The developer should explicitly check the condition upon wake-up and, if the condition is unmet, the thread should go back to a waiting state or handle it appropriately.
